== Taskman - task manager for long-running applications with web-interface

Taskman - is a website for enqueuing and control long-running tasks (for our bioinformatics laboratory). Project is very raw, don't use it.

In order to create new type of tasks one should create class subclassing <tt>Taskman::TaskValidator</tt> and define rails-style validators. Also you should create a controller and routes to handle this kind of task. Appropriate view should have a form which collects task parameters and checks validity of specified parameters. If everything is ok, controller dumps these parameters to a queue of tasks and when there is a free consumer, this task will be loaded from queue and specific <tt>Taskman::Task</tt> will be created and run. 

When task was consumed - its state changes and it moves to another place where one can check its status. When task finishes, consumer sends notification to the server so that server can take results and make appropriate status changes.

Each task has an unique ticket id which identifies it. Parameters of task are hashed in order not to resend duplicated tasks. Tasks are compared by hash and content and if one task is a duplicate of another - task enqueuing rejects and user is redirected to ticket obtained earlier.
